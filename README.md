In Expression Blend you can use the library without code. 
Just add IpdsMultTouch.dll to project references. 
After this you can easily drag and drop TouchManiulatorBehavior from Assets/Behaviors to the control that you can make touchable. 
Set ContainerControl and add gestures to the behavior. 
Gestures can be built-in (like scale, translate, rotate) or your own and can be set on properties of the behavior. 
More gesture can be added.
